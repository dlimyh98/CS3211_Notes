/* Analysis of program */
/* 1. Either line 8 (write_x) or line 12 (write_y) happened first
*  2.1 If line 17 returns false (y.load is false), means that line 8 (write_x) happened first
*  2.2 If line 23 returns false (x.load is false), means that line 12 (write_y) happened first
*  
*  So even if one thread doesn't increment z, the other thread will.
*  This is because eventually, the changes in x and y have to be seen in the SAME ORDER through ALL threads.
